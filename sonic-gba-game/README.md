This game is inspired by the scene in Sonic 3 where Robotnik dances through lasers. Press Start/Enter to play.

How to play:
You are playing as Robotnik. You are surrounded by red lasers and will lose if you touch them. To win, bring Robotnik to the Master Emerald at the bottom right of the screen.

Use arrow keys to move Robotnik around. 
	Right = Right Arrow
	Left = Left Arrow
	Up = Up Arrow
	Down = Down Arrow

Pressing Select/Backspace at any point during the game will restart the game to the title screen.

If you win or lose, pressing Select/Backspace will restart the game to the title screen.

To avoid tearing, if you touch the borders of the timer, Robotnik's position will reset to the beginning.
