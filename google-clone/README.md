# About
Using HTML and CSS, I've recreated the older Google homepage (exported as an HTML Document).  

The "Google" heading has been replaced with "CS 1301" in the same color theme because this made for my class project. 
Each quick action in the upper left and right of the screen navigates to the correct Google site.
