### **Hey there!** ˚⟡˖ ࣪

I'm Kunisha, an undergraduate computer science student focused on software and web development. 

I enjoy building projects that aim to solve real problems and/or serve as an outlet for my own interests, such as my Sonic inspired game! 

I've mostly used React, Python, Java, Node.js, and MySQL for my work.
